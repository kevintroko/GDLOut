## Intro
Netflix, Youtube, Facebook, Foursquare, Amazon and many other software companies now use recomendation algorithms to recommend the best options available on their services according to user's interest. Content recommendation is nowadays very common and really useful to engage users on software platforms. These services deal with a huge number of users and databases of items and software platforms should be constantly dealing with proposing new recommendations each time according to the constant change that exists on user's interests.
\newline In this project we use a graph representation to recommend activities to do in the Metropolitan Zone of Guadalajara through the application of traversal algorithms. To achieve this, we designed a representation of the activities in a graph structure and implemented a modified version of the bread first search algorithm that uses our data for recommendation. This algorithm is capable of recommend activities available to do in Guadalajara according to user's interest.
